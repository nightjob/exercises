# Exercises

Let's combine everything we know.

Please complete all of these in one repository. Create a new local folder, and a new git repository, `exercises`. Remember to run `npm init` to register it as a Javascript package, so you can use `npm commands.` Remembe to run the `git` commands from the Github repo after you create a new repo. You will not need to do the SSH key creation stuff again - that is set to your account. Just the new git repo instructions are fine!

Do each numbered exercise in a different folder.
For instance, if you make a folder called `exercises`, do the first homework in `exercises/1`, then the next in `exercises/2`.

You can use whatever folder structure you like other than that. For instance, `exercises/3/game/game.js`, `exercises/3/user/user.js`, etc.

On to the exercises!

1. Using the `prompt-promise` npm library, ask the user a math question, ie: "What is 5 + 7?". Verify the user has provided answer, and if not, tell the user it is incorrect. The user can have a maximum amount of guesses of 3 - after that, they can no longer guess and the program should exit. If the user is correct, let them know, and the program should exist.
`complete`

2. Write a function that takes a minimum number and a maximum number, and using a for loop, log out all odd numbers between the min and the max, NOT including the min or max themselves.
`complete`

3. Mock out some functionality of Steam.
   a) Declare a class `Game` that takes two arguments in it's constructor, `name` and `price`.
   b) Create 5 games with different names and prices.
   c) Declare a class: `SteamUser`, that takes one argument in it's constructor ,`balance` and sets this property on the user, as well as an empty array `games`.

   c) Write a function on that SteamUser class that lets a user purchase a game, if they have enough `balance` to afford the `price` of the game. If they can not afford it, throw an error.
   d) Write a function on that SteamUser class that lets a user wishlist a game. If they already own it, throw an error.
   e) Write a function on that SteamUser that logs out a SteamUser's games alphabetically.
   f) Change the function you wrote in `e)` to take a single argument, `sortType`, to let the user decide to sort them alphabetically or by price. Change the function to use that sortType and sort appropriately based on it.
`started`

4. Let's monitor Ethereum activity in real time!
   a) Sign up for a free Infura account.
   b) Using the `ethers` npm library, display the following information:

   - Current block number
   - Current gas price
   - Current chain id

   c) Using the `prompt-promise` npm library, prompt a user to provide an ethereum address, and then: - Display the Ethereum balance of that account to the user in the terminal. If it is not a valid ethereum address, display an error. The balance should be converted from `wei` to `ether`. - Display the transaction count of that account to the user in the terminal.
